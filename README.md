# Smile at Work

Smile at Work allows employees to pulse "check-in" their mood, voice their opinions, and act upon crowdsourced micro-tasks to improve the team mood and shape team culture each day. 

It is built using React Native and integrated with Firebase so that Team Thoughts persist between sessions. For the strength of this high-fidelity prototype, whatever "mood" is checked-in by the user becomes the overall team's mood for that day.
